## 2 minute video pitch
On YouTube: 

## the initial idea and why you wanted to build it

In these days, where not all employees have technical company equipment available, it is difficult to contribute to the daily work.

One possibility to contribute is to learn. To learn new skills, tech skills, language skills and so forth.

There are many interesting learning platforms in the internet. But which is the appropiate one? Which course makes sense

for the current or future job?


## what the product does and which problem it solves

We want to build a company tool which gives the employees the opportunity to choose the right learning course. Company mentors can 

recommand the right course for a specific job. Attendees can vote for courses they have attended. Our planned prototype

is an online intranet platform.


## how you built it and with what tech stack, tools, APIs

We are using a httpd server, php, python, html5, css3 and sqlite3.


## what were the biggest challenges while building it?

This is our first online hackathon. We are not so familiar how to build something with colocated coworks yet. But we learn quick.


## how did you solve them?

We communicate often together. 


## what are you proud of about this product

We are proud of our idea and the spirit which leads us together.


## what are the next steps for the product after the HR Hackathon online?

We want to finish our prototype. First, we will work on our frontend-design. 
We are looking forward to get feedback from all teammates. We hope that our idea helps employees.


## what are the necessary resources and plan to implement the product

Our tools are open source, so we can continue to develop it.
